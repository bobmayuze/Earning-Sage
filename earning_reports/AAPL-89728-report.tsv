Timothy Cook	Chief Executive Officer and Director at Apple	Thank you. Suhasini. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us. Today, we're reporting revenue of $94.8 billion for the March quarter, which was better than our expectations. We set an all-time record for services and our March quarter record for iPhone. We were particularly pleased with the performance we saw in emerging markets and achieved all time records in Mexico, Indonesia, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the UAE as well as a number of March quarter records, including in Brazil, Malaysia, and India. This result is a testament, first and foremost to our teams around the world who are engaged every day and the work of bringing new innovations to life. It speaks to the incredible power of Apple products and services to enrich people's lives in indispensable ways. And whether it's in the design lab in Cupertino, or in one of the brand-new retail stores in India, I am constantly inspired by the way our people come together to make a real difference in the world.
Timothy Cook	Chief Executive Officer and Director at Apple	During the March quarter, we continue to face foreign-exchange headwinds, which had an impact of more than 500 basis-points, as well as ongoing challenges related to the macroeconomic environment. Revenue was down 3% year-over-year as a result, while on a constant-currency basis, we grew in total and in the vast majority of the markets we track.
Timothy Cook	Chief Executive Officer and Director at Apple	Despite these challenges, we continue to manage for the long-term and to push the limits of what's possible always-on behalf of the customers who depend on our products, whether it's students exploring new frontiers, developers dreaming up their next big idea or artist taking their creativity to a whole new level.
Timothy Cook	Chief Executive Officer and Director at Apple	Let me share how these results showed up across our lineup of products and services. Let's start with iPhone, which set a new March quarter record with revenue of $51.3 billion. The iPhone 14 and 14 plus continue to delight users with their long-lasting battery and advanced camera. And our pro users continue to rave about the most powerful camera system ever in an iPhone. This March, we were excited to expand emergency SoS via satellite to six new countries bringing this important safety feature to even more users. We now offer this vital service in 12 countries and I'm grateful for every note, I've received from around the world about the lifesaving impact of our safety features.
Timothy Cook	Chief Executive Officer and Director at Apple	Now let's turn to Mac, which recorded $7.2 billion in revenue for the March quarter, in-line with our expectations. As we noted during our last call, Mac faced a very difficult compare, because of the incredibly successful rollout of our M1 ships throughout the Mac lineup last year. And like our other product lines, Mac, is facing some macroeconomic and foreign-exchange headwinds as well. That said, the advancements we've made and power-efficient performance continue to amaze our users. Are M2 Mac mini customers are raving about the pro level powerhouse packed into an ultra compact design and users are marveling at the power and speed at the heart of every M2 powered MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which allow them to sustain even the most demanding workloads.
Timothy Cook	Chief Executive Officer and Director at Apple	IPad revenue was $6.7 billion, which was also in-line with our expectations. Similar to Mac, iPad revenue performance was impacted by macroeconomic challenges, foreign exchange headwinds and a difficult compare with last year when we launched the M1 powered iPad Air. IPad's versatility continues to be its greatest strength, as we're helping students learn on the same family of devices are just used to create their next masterpiece.
Timothy Cook	Chief Executive Officer and Director at Apple	Across Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $8.8 billion. With its exceptional range of game-changing health and safety features, Apple Watch becomes more-and-more indispensable everyday.

We achieved all-time revenue records across App Store, Apple Music, iCloud and payment services and now with more than $975 million paid subscriptions, we're reaching even more people with our lineup for Services. Apple TV Plus continues to draw praise from customers and reviewers alike. During the past quarter fans tuned in to incredible new series like shrinking and the big door prize and got to welcome Ted Lasso back into their homes for a third season. Movies like Tetris are captivating viewers with many more to come, including Martin Scorsese's ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" later this year."
Timothy Cook	Chief Executive Officer and Director at Apple	"Three years since its launch Apple TV plus programing has been celebrated across the globe with over 1,450 nominations and more than 350 wins.

Timothy Cook	Chief Executive Officer and Director at Apple	In March, we also launched Apple Pay Later designed with users privacy and financial health in mind, Apple Pay Later allows users to split purchases into multiple payments with no interest or fees. And last month we introduced apple cart savings accounts to give users, even more value out of their daily cash Apple Card benefit.
Timothy Cook	Chief Executive Officer and Director at Apple	At Apple, our customers are at the center of everything we do. Nowhere is that more evident than retail where our teams are dedicated to sharing the best of Apple, with our customers. And we're constantly innovating to deliver exceptional experiences and meet our customers where they are. In the U.S., we launched shop with a specialist over video a new way for customers to learn about iPhone and find the one that's just right for them. And as I noted earlier, in a milestone for Apple, we just opened our first two Apple stores in India, in Mumbai and Delhi. I was there to see it for myself and I couldn't have been more delighted by the excitement and enthusiasm of the customers, developers, creatives and team members I got to spend time with.
Timothy Cook	Chief Executive Officer and Director at Apple	I've had the chance to connect with customers and teams all-around the world in recent months. So many people shared with me that they were fans of Apple, not just because of the innovations we create, but because of the values that guide us, and that means a great deal to us. We are constantly striving to make a positive difference in people's lives and be a force for progress. We're investing in education to give students the skills they need to shape the future. We're helping to create pathways of opportunity for communities of color through our racial equity and justice initiative. And every day, we're building an even more inclusive and diverse Apple rooted in our culture of belonging.
Timothy Cook	Chief Executive Officer and Director at Apple	To better understand how our work intersects with our values, look no further than what we're doing for the environment. We just celebrated Earth Day in April. And during that month, Apple announced that its global manufacturing partners now support over 13 gigawatts of renewable energy a nearly 30% increase in just the last year. This translates to 17.4 million metric tons of avoided carbon emissions, the equivalent of removing nearly 3.8 million cars from the road.
Timothy Cook	Chief Executive Officer and Director at Apple	We're also investing up to an additional $200 million and our Restore Fund, which is designed to support innovative, scalable nature based carbon removal projects, with the goal of removing one million metric tons of carbon every year. These are just the latest steps on our journey towards our 2030 goal to be carbon-neutral across our supply-chain and life-cycle of our devices. At the same time, we're advancing renewable energy across our supply-chain, we are also sourcing more recycled materials in our products.
Timothy Cook	Chief Executive Officer and Director at Apple	Last month, we announced our plans to have all Apple-designed batteries, include a 100% certified recycled cobalt by 2025. And we remain committed to [Technical Issues]. using only recycled and renewable materials in our products. We have a deep sense of mission here at Apple. We believe in the power of innovation to build a better world. We are determined to do our best work on behalf of our customers and to give them the tools that can enrich lives. So we will manage for the long-term. Just as we always have, with our eyes to the horizon with limitless creativity and with a deep belief that we can achieve anything we put our minds to.
Timothy Cook	Chief Executive Officer and Director at Apple	With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.
Luca Maestri	Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President at Apple	Thank you, Tim and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $94.8 billion, down 3% from last year embedded in our expectations. Foreign-exchange had a negative impact of over five percentage points on our results, in-line with what we had expected. On a constant-currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total and in the majority of the markets we track. In addition to that, records in emerging markets that, Tim mentioned, we also set March quarter records in Australia, Canada, Spain and Switzerland, among others.
Luca Maestri	Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President at Apple	Products revenue was $73.9 billion, down 5% from last year, due to challenging compares on Mac and iPad. IPhone, however, the recent March quarter revenue record, thanks to very strong performance in emerging markets from South Asia and India to Latin-America and the Middle-East. During the quarter, our installed-base of active devices continue to grow at a nice pace, thanks to extremely high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and reached an all-time high for all major product categories and geographic segments. Our Services set an all time revenue record of $20.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year, on-top of growing 17% in the March quarter a year ago. We reached an all-time Services revenue record in Greater China and March quarter records in Americas, Europe and Rest of Asia-Pacific.

Partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 36.7%, decreasing 30 basis-points sequentially, due to seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 71%, up 20 basis-points sequentially. Operating expenses of $13.7 billion, were at the low-end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and continued to decelerate from the December quarter.

IPhone revenue set a March quarter record of $51.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year, despite significant foreign-exchange headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. We set March quarter records in several developed and emerging markets with India, Indonesia, Turkey and the UAE doubling on a year-over-year basis.
Luca Maestri	Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President at Apple	Our active installed-base of iPhone grew to a new all-time high, and was up in all our geographic segments. We are very pleased by the results of the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research, which measured customer satisfaction at 99% for the iPhone 14 framework. Mac revenue was $7.2 billion, down 31% year-over-year and in-line with our expectations. These results were driven by the challenging macroeconomic environment, coupled with a difficult compare against last year's launch of the completely re-imagined M1 MacBook Pros. Despite this, the installed-base of active Mac's reached an all-time high across all geographic segments, and we continue to see strong upgraded activity to Apple Silicon. Also the latest survey of U.S., consumers from 451 Research, reported customer satisfaction of 96% for Mac.
Luca Maestri	Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President at Apple	IPad generated $6.7 billion in revenue, down 13% year-over-year and in-line with our expectations. This performance was due to two key factors, a tough compare against the launch of iPad Air powered by the M1 chip-in the year-ago quarter and headwinds from the macroeconomic environment. The iPad installed-base reached a new all-time high in all geographic segments. Thanks to exceptional customer loyalty and a high number of new customers, in fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPass during the quarter were new to the product.
Luca Maestri	Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President at Apple	Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $8.8 billion, down 1% year-over-year as the category experienced the impact from the macroeconomic environment. However, we did set March quarter records both in the U.S. and in Greater China. We continue to see strength in our watch installed base, which set a new all-time record. Thanks to very-high customer loyalty and new tool rates. Nearly 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product.
Luca Maestri	Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President at Apple	Moving to Services, we reached a new all-time revenue record of $20.9 billion and in addition to the all-time records, Tim mentioned earlier. We said, March quarter records for advertising Apple Care and video. Despite these records as we saw in recent quarters, certain services offerings such as digital advertising and mobile gaming, continued to be affected by the current macroeconomic environment.
Luca Maestri	Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President at Apple	Stepping back. However, the continued growth in Service is the reflection of our ecosystem strength and the positive momentum we're seeing across several key metrics.
Luca Maestri	Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President at Apple	First, our growing installed-base of over 2 billion active devices represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem. We continue to grow across every major product category and geographic segment. Thanks to very-high levels of customer loyalty and satisfaction. Second, we saw increased customer engagement with our Services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double-digits year-over-year, each setting a new all-time record. Third paid subscriptions, showed strong growth. We now have more than 975 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 150 million during the last 12 months and nearly double the number of paid subscriptions, we had only three years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current Services offerings from new content on Apple TV Plus to great new features available in Apple Pay and Apple Music, which we believe our customers will love.
Luca Maestri	Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President at Apple	Turning to the enterprise market, we see business customers continuing to invest in the Apple platform to drive higher employee productivity and satisfaction. In Brazil, boutique carrier group, the world's largest cosmetics franchiser, originally starting with iPhone 12 employees manage operations across our network of retail stores, franchisees and resellers. As it continues to digitize its business, but the carrier chosen to move all software development in-house and adopted Mac as the standard device for all of their developer teams across the world.

As we celebrate National Small Business week here in the U.S., we are proud to continue supporting the small-business community.
Luca Maestri	Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President at Apple	Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $166 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by about $300 million, leaving us with total debt of $110 billion. As a result, net cash was $57 billion at the end-of-the quarter. During the March quarter, we returned over $23 billion to shareholders, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19.1 billion through open-market repurchases of 129 million Apple shares.
Luca Maestri	Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President at Apple	Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today, our Board has authorized an additional $90 billion for share repurchases, as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash-neutral over-time. We're also raising our dividend by 4%, to $0.24 a share and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going-forward.
Luca Maestri	Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President at Apple	As we move ahead into the June quarter. I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that's Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our June quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the March quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook does not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.
Luca Maestri	Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President at Apple	Foreign-exchange will continue to be a headwind and we expect a negative year-over-year impact of nearly 4 percentage points. For Services, we expect our June quarter year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to the March quarter, while continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds in areas such as digital advertising and mobile gaming.
Luca Maestri	Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President at Apple	We expect gross margin to be between 44% and 44.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $13.6 billion and $13.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax-rate to be around 16%. Finally, reflecting the dividend increase I mentioned earlier, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on May 18, 2023 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2023.
Luca Maestri	Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President at Apple	With that, let's open the call to questions.
