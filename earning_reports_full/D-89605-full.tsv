Operator	Operator	Welcome to the Dominion Energy First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. Instructions will be given for the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question. I would now like to turn the call over to David McFarland, Vice-President, Investor Relations.
David McFarland	Vice President, Investor Relations at Dominion Energy	Good morning and thank you for joining today's call.
David McFarland	Vice President, Investor Relations at Dominion Energy	Earnings materials, including today's prepared remarks, contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's estimates and expectations.
David McFarland	Vice President, Investor Relations at Dominion Energy	This morning, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which we can calculate are contained in the earnings release kit. I encourage you to visit our Investor Relations website to review webcast slides as well as the earnings release kit.
David McFarland	Vice President, Investor Relations at Dominion Energy	Joining today's call are Bob Blue, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steven Ridge, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Diane Leopold, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer.
David McFarland	Vice President, Investor Relations at Dominion Energy	I will now turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Thank you, David and good morning, everyone.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	During the first quarter, we delivered financial results consistent with our guidance range and made meaningful progress on regulated investment programs, we decarbonized and add resiliency to our systems. We'll cover those topics in more detail, but let me begin with safety performance, and then address the status of the business review.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Our employee OSHA entry recordable rate for the first quarter was 0.21, a significant improvement relative to historical performance including record-setting results in 2020 and 2021. We have several months left in 2023 to demonstrate our ability to drive injuries toward the only acceptable outcome, which is 0, I thank my colleagues for this remarkably strong start to the year.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Now I'd like to address the business review. Our guiding commitments and priorities are unchanged and replicated identically on Slide 3. We continue to receive valuable feedback from investors, which is affirmed our focus on these principles, we will continue to be deliberate and making ourselves available for input from the company's current and prospective capital providers.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	The review timeline shown on Slide 4 is also unchanged. We plan to host an Investor Day in the third quarter during which will provide an updated strategic and financial outlook, based on the results of the business review, which is still underway. We're working expeditiously but conscientiously in recognition of the vital importance of achieving an optimal result. I'm pleased with the progress we're making towards delivering a compelling repositioning of our company to create maximum long-term value for shareholders, employees, customers and other stakeholders. We have great people and great assets and I'm as excited as ever for the future of our company.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Turning now to several noteworthy developments in Virginia, our largest service area. In November, I discussed the need to ensure that near-term economic and customer bill pressures didn't preclude the full realization of the benefits of a long-term resiliency and decarbonization capital investment opportunity before us. And in February, I discussed the need for a durable regulatory construct that provides for a competitive in fair return on utility investments to attract low-cost capital in support of our customer focus programs.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	New Virginia law enacted in April and effective July first comprehensively addresses both of those needs. It provides significant bill relief for our customers and supports the long-term stability of our utility. With nearly unanimous bipartisan support, the legislation provides the certainty, we need to fund and execute critical energy investments in support of the Commonwealth's robust electric demand growth long-term energy security and reliability leading decarbonization goals, an impressive economic growth.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Highlights of the law are shown on Slide 5. First, it provides meaningful rate relief for customers. Beginning July one it reduces the monthly bill for a typical residential customer by nearly $7, through the combination of certain existing riders that represent approximately $350 million of annual revenue. And it allows for the commission to approve the securitization of deferred fuel costs, which could provide up to $7 a month, and additional near-term savings. If approved fuel securitization would reduce the standalone fuel charge on customers' monthly bills by allowing the company to spread, fuel costs over a multi-year period. Taken together, these savings if approved would equate to a 10% reduction to the current typical residential customer bill and position us to be around 21% below the national average.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Second, the law simplifies the rate-making process around our base business, which now represents about a third of the EVs total rate base. Specifically, the law reinstates base rate reviews on a biennial schedule as compared to the current triennial cadence, improving the timeliness of operating expense and investment recovery. It's worth noting here, no change to the use of a forward-looking mechanism for purposes of establishing base rate revenues as part of the now biennial reviews. And it retains a modified customer sharing mechanism for base rate earnings that allows both customers and shareholders to benefit from positive financial drivers like improve cost-efficiency.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Finally, the law prescribes certain regulatory parameters for use in rate saving setting for the next few years. It establishes an authorized ROE of 9.7%, up from 9.305% currently. For purposes of the 2023 biennial review, which will determine base rates and rider returns through the next biennial period. It to undertake reasonable efforts to maintain a common equity ratio of 52.1% through 2024. And it preserves the use of the rider recovery construct. As a reminder, riders are filed and trued up annually in single issue proceedings that utilized forward-looking test periods and allow for timely recovery of construction work-in progress. The law complements precedent energy legislation, including the Virginia Clean Economy Act of 2020, the Grid Transformation and Security Act of 2018 and the reregulation Act of 2017, to create a regulated utility framework that has delivered exemplary reliability and resiliency, as well as exceptional customer value. As evidenced by customer rates that are significantly below national and regional averages as shown on Slide 6.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	I believe this broadly supported bipartisan legislation strikes an appropriate balance between customer benefit, regulatory oversight and the critical need to position the company to compete for capital to support the significant investment required in Virginia for decades to come. In the words of the State House of delegates leadership, this resolution gives Dominion Energy, Virginia, the certainty and stability to make investments needed to ensure stable, reliable service, long into the future.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	That stability and certainty is especially critical now as we ramp into the very substantial and growing multi-decade utility investment required to address resiliency and decarbonization public policy goals plus recently updated independent electric load projections that reflect the very robust demand growth, we're observing in Real-time across our system. I'm referring to PJMs 2023 forecast, that is shown on Slide 7 projects peak summer load growth in the Dom Zone of approximately 5% per year for the next 10 years.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	To put that into perspective, the resulting peak load projected for 2033 has increased from 25.8 gigawatts as of the 2022 PJM estimates to 35.8 gigawatts as of this year's estimate an increase of nearly 40%. DEE [Phonetic] weather normal sales growth over the last 12 months was 6.1%. For full-year 2023, we expect the growth rate to moderate somewhat to around 5%. So, this isn't a hypothetical growth it's demand we're seeing and investing to serve every day. On Monday, we filed an updated integrated resource plan with the Virginia Commission that outlines a variety of paths to satisfy these growing service obligations. The plan calls for an acceleration of and long-term increase in our distribution, transmission and generation investment. We look-forward to engaging with all stakeholders in the planning process and we'll provide a refresh long-term capital investment plan as part of our third-quarter investor day.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	This unique intersection of industry-leading demand growth and strong policy support for resiliency decarbonization, affordability, and economic growth, combined with the durability of the Virginia regulatory construct represents an unprecedented opportunity for our company, our customers and our shareholders. It will drive growth for many years to come, require prudent capital allocation and rely on a healthy financial foundation, which is one of the reasons we've repeatedly highlighted balance sheet improvement as a key priority of the business review.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	With that, I'll turn it over to Steven to address the financial matters, before I provide additional business updates.
Steven Ridge	Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Oficer at Dominion Energy	Thank you, Bob and good morning. Our first quarter 2023 operating earnings as shown on Slide 8, were $0.99 per share, which included $0.10 of hurt [Phonetic] from worse than normal weather in our utility service areas. I'll note that this was one of the warmest first quarters on record for our electric utility service areas. Positive factors as compared to last year, were normal course regulated growth, higher sales and higher Millstone margins. Other factors in addition to weather, includes higher interest expense, lower DEV margins for certain utility customer contracts with market-based rates. The absence of solar investment tax credits and O&M timing.
Steven Ridge	Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Oficer at Dominion Energy	Normalized for the negative impact of weather, our results would have been $1.9 per share above the midpoint of our weather normal guidance range by $0.04 as a result of a combination of several small drivers including Millstone margins depreciation and taxes. First-quarter GAAP results reflect a net income of $1.17 per share, which includes the positive non-cash mark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities and unrealized gains in the value of our nuclear decommissioning trust funds. A summary of all adjustments between operating and reported results is included in Schedule two of the earnings release kit.
Steven Ridge	Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Oficer at Dominion Energy	Moving now to guidance on Slide 9. Given the pending business review, we are not providing full-year 2023 earnings guidance. For the second quarter of 2023, we expect operating earnings to be between $0.58 and $0.68 per share. Last year's second quarter operating earnings were $0.77 and included $1 hurt from worse than normal weather. The second quarter 2023 guidance midpoint of $0.63 per share represents a decline of $0.14 as compared to last year, but is in-line with our expectations since the beginning of the year.
Steven Ridge	Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Oficer at Dominion Energy	Let me spend a minute on the key drivers for the quarter as compared to last year. Positive drivers include higher sales, lower Millstone planned outage impacts normal weather and modest O&M timing. Other drivers are primarily and as previously highlighted, higher interest rates lower DEV margins for certain utility customer contracts with market-based rates and the lack of solar ITCs.
Steven Ridge	Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Oficer at Dominion Energy	Turning now to credit. For the avoidance of doubt, there have been no changes to our business review commitments and priorities, including with regard to credit. As we've discussed, despite meaningful qualitative improvement over the last several years, our credit metrics need strengthening. This was highlighted by S&P who recently [Indecipherable] revised its outlook from stable to negative for the Dominion family of issuers. Recall that the outlook designation -- designation typically signifies a one-third probability of change in rating over the next 12 to 24 months. I'd note that S&P maintained its standalone credit profile for VEPCO at A and maintain Dominion's business risk profile as excellent but suggested that countermeasures we likely needed to strengthen the company's future credit metrics.
Steven Ridge	Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Oficer at Dominion Energy	As we've said before, we desire to emerge from the review with the ability over-time to consistently meet and exceed our downgrade threshold even during temporary periods of cost or regulatory pressure. As part of the review, we're analyzing the most efficient sources of capital to improve our balance sheet and fund our robust capital investments, while seeking to minimize any amount of external equity financing need. No change on either of these two points from prior investor communications.
Steven Ridge	Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Oficer at Dominion Energy	Turning to Slide 10, and briefly on O&M management. We know it's our responsibility to constantly look for ways to optimize the efficiency of our operations without losing sight on the absolute necessity of meeting high customer service standards. Based on the most recent data published by FERC, last month, we've updated our electric O&M management relative to peers. As you can see, we have a track-record of operating efficiently -- efficiently for our customers and shareholders, which is clearly reflected as Bob described on Slide 6 in our competitive rates as compared to national and regional averages. We've driven down costs through improved processes innovative use of technology and other best practice initiatives. As part of the review, we are evaluating what we can additionally do on costs within the context of the significant operational and cost-efficiency we achieved over the years.
Steven Ridge	Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Oficer at Dominion Energy	Before turning it back over to Bob, let me echo his enthusiasm for the future of our company. I too am encouraged by the progress of the review and look-forward to sharing the results during our Investor Meeting later this year. I'll now turn the call-back over to Bob.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Thanks, Stephen. I'll now turn to other business updates and the execution of our growth program. Turning to offshore wind on Slide 11, the project remains on-track and on-budget. We continue to work closely with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and other stakeholders to support the project timeline. The draft EIS received late last year was thorough and contain no surprises. Public hearings have already taken place and we continue to work collaboratively with BOEM and all of the cooperating agencies. We expect the EIS Record of Decision later this year, we've advanced engineering and design work, which has allowed us to release major equipment for fabrication. And we've made progress on procurement and other pre-construction activities for the onshore scope of work.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Consistent with prior guidance project costs, excluding contingency are about 90% fixed, further derisking the project and its budget. Project to date, we've invested approximately $1.5 billion, which we expect to grow to $3.3 billion by year end. In our most recent regulatory filing, we updated our expected LCOE to the low-end of the $80 to $90 per MW range to account for PTC value-based on the Inflation Reduction Act. In March, legislation was enacted that authorizes the EV to establish an offshore wind affiliate subject to commission approval and for the purpose of securing non-controlling equity financing partner in our offshore wind project. We intend to evaluate this option as part of the business review.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Our Jones Act compliant turbine installation vessel is currently 70% complete. No change to our expected expectation of the completion well in advance of the need to support the current Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind construction schedule and timely completion by the end of 2026. On datacenters, we're advancing a series of infrastructure upgrade projects that will enable incremental increases in power for datacenter customers in Eastern Loudoun County. The first three projects are ahead of schedule and will be completed by the end of this month. A second tranche of projects are on-schedule to be completed by the end of 2023. Additionally, we recently received SEC approval for a new 500 KV transmission line, with an expected in-service date of late 2025. This submission included around $700 million of capital investment.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Turning to Slide 13, I'm very pleased that the SEC in April approved our most recent Clean Energy filing, which included nearly 800 MW of solar and energy storage capacity, our sixth consecutive such approval. These projects will bring jobs and economic opportunity to our communities and they will deliver more than $250 million in fuel savings for our customers during their first 10 years in operation. Our next Clean Energy filing will take place later this year.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Next, we're advancing our electric grid transformation plans to create a more resilient grid, improve reliability and offer faster recovery after major storms. We filed Phase-III of our grid transformation plan in March, seeking approval for the continuation of existing and new projects through 2026. Our customers have already observed, the benefits from prior investments as we've seen fewer outages and less significant damage on impacted facilities during major storms. The filing represented over $1 billion of rider eligible investments. We expect an order from the SEC by the end-of-the third quarter of 2023.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Turning to South Carolina, on March 31st, we filed a natural gas general rate case in South Carolina in accordance with its 2020 RSA settlement agreement with the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff. We asked in the case for an ROE of 10.8% and our revenue requirement increase of $19 million, which represents around a 6% increase to a typical residential customer bill. We expect new rates based on a typical procedural schedule to be effective in October. On April 25th, the commission approved our stipulation in the electric fuel proceeding. The stipulation was prepared through the joint efforts of DEFC [Phonetic], the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff and the South Carolina energy users Committee. The stipulation supports an increase of just under 4% for an average residential customer bill. We now expect to recover all previous under collections during the next few year. I'd note that this is the second electric fuel adjustment settlement in the past six months. Another example of the improved regulatory and stakeholder relationships that will benefit our customers in the state.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Lastly, at our gas distribution business, the Utah System delivered seven of the top 20 throughput days in history, including the two highest-ever during a record-setting winter. Also, in Utah we've launched the next phase of our hydrogen blending pilot and we've achieved up to 5% blending levels in Delta serving about 1,800 customers. On RNG, we have six RNG projects currently injecting gas with 15 projects under various stages of development. With that, let me summarize our remarks on Slide 14.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Our safety performance this quarter was outstanding. But more work to do to drive injuries to 0. We delivered financial results that were within our guidance range and above the midpoint of our guidance range on a weather normal basis. We continue to execute on our decarbonization and resiliency investment programs, to meet our customers' needs, while creating jobs and spurring new business growth. Our offshore wind project continues to move forward on-schedule and on-budget. And the top-to-bottom business review is proceeding with pace and purpose. I'm focused on ensuring that Dominion Energy is best positioned to create significant long-term value for our shareholders.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	With that, we're ready to take your questions.
Operator	Operator	Thank you. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
Shahriar Pourreza	Analyst at Guggenheim Partners	Good morning, guys.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Good morning, Shahr.
Shahriar Pourreza	Analyst at Guggenheim Partners	Good morning. Maybe just probably we could start with a kind of a sequencing question regarding the Investor Day, as it kind of draws closer. Should we be expecting kind of a turnkey Investor Day reset or could it still be contingent on potential ongoing sale processes and the origin of the question is that the Wind stake sale, seems to be taking a while right now, you had that option now. So just trying to get a feel for what level of closure you're targeting for the rollout?
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Yeah, Shahr, we're targeting as we have said from the beginning, being able to give a very good sense of long-term for our company. So, no change from what we expected when we started or when we most recently updated.
Shahriar Pourreza	Analyst at Guggenheim Partners	Got it, perfect and Steven you mentioned in the prepared that you continue to look at cost efficiencies, albeit within the context of all the work you've done to date. I guess how should we think about the opportunities here? Any color on scale or timing as we look-ahead to the review and beyond?
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Yeah, thanks Shahr. I think on the third-quarter call of 2022 when we announced the business review. We did make some commentary on our focus on continuing our track-record of being a very efficient operator. And I think what we said at the time, which I think was well put by Jim Chapman, was that while we believe there is opportunity and we're constantly focused and looking at that, we don't view it in the -- through a lens of a game-changer amount of incremental savings to what we've consistently accomplished. So, as we're working through the business review, we continue to expect to find incremental efficiencies, but we've been driving a lot of those efficiencies -- inefficiencies out-of-the business for a number of years, as reflected in our O&M efficiency metrics in our rates.
Shahriar Pourreza	Analyst at Guggenheim Partners	Perfect. I think, just one last one, I guess just on the FTC, guess [Phonetic] what your kind of expectations for lawmakers I guess to fill the two vacant seats at this point? Sounds like there's been little progress in Richmond. I guess, what are the pathways forward here? Thanks guys.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Yeah, Shar. I think it's important to start-off by noting that the commission is functioning effectively. As evidenced by order it's just within the last few weeks that I mentioned in our opening remarks on our Clean-Energy-3 filing 800 MW of solar and storage. And on the transmission line that's important for us to be able to serve datacenter customers in Northern Virginia. So, the commission is functioning well in its current configuration. I can tell you that the process and the constitution of Virginia, is that when there are vacancies, the General Assembly can elect judges to fill commissioners, to fill those vacancies. If they are not in session, Governor could make an appointment for a term that would last until 30 days after the start of the next regular session. So that's the -- the process, but I think it's important if you sort of step-back and think about the regulatory construct in Virginia.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	If you look just at where we sit in Virginia. We've got low rates; we've got strong reliability. We've got a clear mandate from policy makers for energy security within an energy transition and as our IRP indicates, we've got very strong load growth. So, we're sitting in a very good spot. Moving forward in the Virginia regulatory process. So, the commission is functioning now. There is a process for adding two new commissioners, but sort of in the big picture, we're very well-positioned in Virginia for strong regulatory outcomes in the future.
Shahriar Pourreza	Analyst at Guggenheim Partners	Perfect, guys. Thank you, guys, that's all I had. Have a great weekend.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Thank you, Shahr.
Operator	Operator	And we'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Good morning.
Steve Fleishman	Analyst at Wolfe Research	Yeah, hi, good morning, thank you. Good morning, Steve. So just... good morning, Bob. So just on the framing of the Investor Day, the -- a lot of the balance sheet FX release, it seems like it could come from -- could come from asset sales and -- and the like, and markets kind of keep moving around and the like, so just [Indecipherable] the Investor Day should we assume that asset sales, if you're going to do any are actually kind of announced by then or that this process, would kind of kick-off by then. Yeah, thanks.
Steven Ridge	Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Oficer at Dominion Energy	Hey Steve. This is Steve, I'll take a shot at that as well. I think as we think about the Investor Day, the goal is to have isolated as many variables of the review as possible at the time that we address the market with the repositioning of the company for the long-term. And obviously, given the business review is underway, it's a little bit difficult to provide sort of more specific guidance than that, but we are well down the path on the review, but as Bob mentioned, we're pleased with the progress that we're making and we look to use the Investor Day to provide a refreshed strategic and financial outlook, that will cover earnings and credit and financing and capital investment and I think based on the progress we've seen to date, we will be well-positioned to do that.
Steve Fleishman	Analyst at Wolfe Research	Okay, makes sense. And just on the -- the performance provision and the ROE in Virginia, can you just talk to, kind of, is there any clear parameter for how they're supposed to judge your performance upside or downside?
Steven Ridge	Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Oficer at Dominion Energy	I think they will need to be some work done within the commission on how that will work. There was a similar provision in the law really starting back in 2007. And so, we see it as an opportunity to demonstrate our excellent performance, when we're in front of the commission but I think it's a little early to establish exactly how that will play-out.
Steve Fleishman	Analyst at Wolfe Research	Okay and then lastly, just on the datacenters is there any better clarity on who is really supposed to be servicing this data center load and planning for it, like is that your obligation as part of PJMN mission [Phonetic] or because they have choice. Is it -- is it not. Could you just give us some sense on how to think about, that aspect to the loan-growth, yeah?
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	We have an obligation to serve customers in Virginia. It's our obligation and we build generation, transmission and distribution as necessary to serve that load. So that's the way that it has worked, that's the way it's going to keep working in the future. So, we've got investments to make, as you see from the IRP.
Steve Fleishman	Analyst at Wolfe Research	Yeah, I mean, even the ones that maybe if they do have on-site generation, they're typically connecting to you as well and using Dominion, at least for wires and backup and the light [Phonetic], is that correct?
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Oh, absolutely. These are large loads, 24 X 7, they need the grid.
Steve Fleishman	Analyst at Wolfe Research	Great. Okay, thank you.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Thanks, Steve.
Operator	Operator	And we'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan.
Jeremy Tonet	Analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.	Hi, good morning.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Good morning, Jeremy.
Steven Ridge	Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Oficer at Dominion Energy	Good morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet	Analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.	Just wanted to touch on the IRP scenarios and just see what factors are, I guess in play between the different scenarios. Just wondering if you would know any notable highlights and resource mix considerations across these scenarios and how that would impact D.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Sure, Jeremy. As you know, we laid out in the plan five different scenarios, some of them required by the commission from decisions in earlier proceedings. We have plans that as they should comply with the Virginia Clean Economy Act, others as I noted required by the commission that don't necessarily comply with the Clean Economy Act, but the commission asked for those scenarios as well. Across all of them what we look for is the appropriate balance between investing to serve our customers, reliably and the cost of that service and compliance with all the rules and regulations that govern us including the Clean Economy Act. This is -- the IRP is snapshot in time. It is what when we look out 15 and then and with certain parameters 25 years what we think our demand will be as projected by PJM and then the investments that we need to make in order to serve that load.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	This changes as you know, over-time when we have further proceedings. It will be adjusted, I'm sure but we as of the time of this filing [Indecipherable] believe that this document lays out a pretty clear roadmap for different ways that we'd be able to serve what is very robust demand growth coming over the course of the next decade and a half or more.
Jeremy Tonet	Analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.	Got it, that's very helpful, thank you for that and small point, but just wanted to pivot for Millstone just wondering if there's any updated thoughts that you could provide there given, I guess, changes in the market.
Bob Blue	Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer at Dominion Energy	Yeah, as we've said in prior calls, Jeremy. We think Millstones an incredibly valuable asset two, New England, both for reliability and decarbonization purposes. Our team operates that plant extraordinarily well and as we think about the future of Millstone, we just see that it's very well-positioned.
Jeremy Tonet	Analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.	Got it that's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.
